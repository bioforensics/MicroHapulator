# MicroHapulator

https://github.com/bioforensics/microhapulator

**MicroHapulator** is software for empirical haplotype calling, analysis, and basic forensic interpretation of microhaplotypes from Illumina sequence data.
Also included are tools for constructing mock genotypes and simulating Illumina sequencing of single- and multiple-contributor samples for testing and development purposes.
MicroHapulator can be configured for use with any published or custom panel.
[MicroHapDB](https://github.com/bioforensics/microhapdb) can be used to prepare marker definitions, population frequencies, and reference sequencesâ€”see [the configuration documentation](https://microhapulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) for more details.


## Installation

Installation with the [Conda package manager](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is recommended.
Full installation instructions are available [here](https://microhapulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

```
conda install -c bioconda microhapulator
```
