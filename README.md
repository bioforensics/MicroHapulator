# MicroHapulator

**MicroHapulator** is a package for simulating targeted sequencing of microhaplotype loci for forensic analysis.
It uses microhap annotations and allele frequencies from [MicroHapDB](https://github.com/bioforensics/microhapdb) to simulate genotypes, and [InSilicoSeq](https://github.com/HadrienG/InSilicoSeq/) to simulate targeted sequencing of user-selected microhap loci.
