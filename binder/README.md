# MicroHapulator Demo

- See [demo-cli.ipynb](demo-cli.ipynb) for a demonstration of how to analyze and interpret microhap sequence data using MicroHapulator's command line interface.
- See [demo-api.ipynb](demo-api.ipynb) for a brief demonstration of some key features of MicroHapulator's Python API if you're interested in using MicroHapulator in Python programs.
- See [demo-sim.ipynb](demo-sim.ipynb) for a demonstration of how the sausage is madeâ€”i.e., how data for mock scenarios is simulated.
