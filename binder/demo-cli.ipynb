    "# MicroHapulator: CLI Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "**MicroHapulator** is software for forensic analysis of microhaplotype sequence data.\n",
    "Features include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- simulating simple (single-contributor) and complex (multi-contributor) DNA samples\n",
    "- simulated MPS sequencing of user-specified microhap panels\n",
    "- genotyping of DNA profiles from simple and complex DNA samples\n",
    "- tools for deterministic and probabilistic interpretation of simple and complex samples\n",
    "\n",
    "MicroHapulator relies on microhap marker definitions and allele frequencies from [MicroHapDB](https://github.com/bioforensics/MicroHapDB) and MPS error models included with [InSilicoSeq](https://github.com/HadrienG/InSilicoSeq/)."

    "The assay targets a panel of 50 microhaplotype markers.\n",
