    "**MicroHapulator** is an application for empirical haplotype calling, analysis, and basic forensic interpretation of microhaplotypes with NGS data.\n",
    "The software is typically run by entering commands in a shell terminal window.\n",
    "This notebook provides an interactive environment intended to introduce the software, interleaving narrative text, shell commands that the reader can execute and re-execute, the output of those commands, and explanatory commentary.\n",
    "To execute the code in the notebook, select the corresponding cell and click the `[> Run]` button at the top of the page (or as a keyboard shortcut, simultaneously press `[shift]` and `[enter]`)."

    "MicroHapulator calls haplotypes by probing NGS reads aligned to a reference sequence for the corresponding marker.\n",
    "Consider the following mock example.\n",
    "The first line shows the reference sequence for the `mh01USC-1pD` marker.\n",
    "Each subsequent line represents an NGS read aligned to the marker sequence.\n",
    "The `*` symbols denote the locations of the SNPs present in the marker, and the `.` symbols denote locations where the NGS read matches the reference.\n",

    "We can examine the aligned reads to determine the number of times each allelic combination (haplotype) occurs.\n",
    "We call this tally a *typing result*.\n",
    "The typing result for this example is as follows: the `C,C,A` haplotype is observed 5 times, the `C,T,C` haplotype is observed 3 times, and the `C,G,A` haplotype is observed 1 time.\n",
    "If we then filter out the `C,G,A` haplotype as erroneous (see below), we can infer a diploid `C,C,A / C,T,C` genotype for this marker.\n",
    "We call this process *genotype prediction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to point about a few observations about this example.\n",
    "- The first aligned read does not span all SNPs at the marker, so it is discarded.\n",
    "- The third aligned read shows an `A` at the 13th position of the marker reference sequence. Whether this reflects true genetic variation or is a technical artifact resulting from sequencing error, it is ignored by MicroHapulator because it is not one of the three SNPs of interest.\n",
    "- The `C,G,A` haplotype is only observed once and is likely a false haplotype resulting from sequencing error at the second SNP of interest in the haplotype. When dozens or hundreds (or thousands!) of reads are successfully sequenced and aligned to the marker reference, it is usually simple to distinguish signal (true haplotypes) from noise (false haplotypes resulting from sequencing error). When the depth of sequencing coverage is low, as it is in this example, it can be more difficult to distinguish signal from noise. Determining appropriate per-marker thresholds (detection thresholds and analytical thresholds) for filtering will typically require a non-trivial amount of testing with the laboratory's NGS sequencing instrument(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this mock example is helpful in building intuition about haplotype calling, manual visual examination is not feasible for performing this task on dozens of markers and (potentially) millions of NGS reads.\n",
    "The MicroHapulator software provides tools that automate haplotype calling and genotype prediction, as well as assist with basic interpretation of the forensic typing result."

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Forensic interpretation refers to the process of determining the conclusions, if any, that can be responsibly drawn by comparing two or more DNA profiles. How confident can one be that two single-source profiles came from the same individual? How confident can one be that one single-source profile is a contributor to a second mixture profile? A variety of approaches exist for addressing these types of questions, some very simple and some very complex. MicroHapulator implements a handful of tools for simple forensic interpretation tasks. It also supports the export of typing results to a format that can be used by state-of-the-art probabilistic genotyping (probgen) programs. Probgen is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but we will demonstrate the basic interpretation capabilities provided by MicroHapulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "One question often encountered during a study or investigation is the number of DNA contributors in an evidentiary sample (or sometimes even a sample collected from a person of interest). A single-source profile will have at most two distinct alleles at any given marker, one from each parental haplotype. However, it's likewise possible that profile with two contributors will *also* have no more than two distinct alleles, even if the contributing genotypes are different (e.g. contributor A may be homozygous for one allele and contributor B homozygous for another allele). But chances are that two or more DNA contributors will result in three or more alleles for at least a *small* number of markers. We can use this to estimate the minimum number of contributors for a profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mhpl8r contrib` command implements a procedure to scan a typing result to determine the maximum number of alleles $N_{\\text{al}}$ present at any single locus. From this, it can calculate the minimum number of DNA contributors $C_{\\text{min}}$ as follows.\n",
