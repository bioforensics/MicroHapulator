    "We can examine the aligned reads to determine the number of times each allelic combination (haplotype) occurs.\n",
    "We call this tally a *typing result*.\n",
    "The typing result for this example is as follows: the `C,C,A` haplotype is observed 5 times, the `C,T,C` haplotype is observed 3 times, and the `C,G,A` haplotype is observed 1 time.\n",
    "If we then filter out the `C,G,A` haplotype as erroneous (see below), we can infer a diploid `C,C,A / C,T,C` genotype for this marker.\n",

    "It is helpful to point about a few observations about this example.\n",
    "- The first aligned read does not span all SNPs at the marker, so it is discarded.\n",
    "- The third aligned read shows an `A` at the 13th position of the marker reference sequence. Whether this reflects true genetic variation or is a technical artifact resulting from sequencing error, it is ignored by MicroHapulator because it is not one of the three SNPs of interest.\n",
    "- The `C,G,A` haplotype is only observed once and is likely a false haplotype resulting from sequencing error at the second SNP of interest in the haplotype. When dozens or hundreds (or thousands!) of reads are successfully sequenced and aligned to the marker reference, it is usually simple to distinguish signal (true haplotypes) from noise (false haplotypes resulting from sequencing error). When the depth of sequencing coverage is low, as it is in this example, it can be more difficult to distinguish signal from noise. Determining appropriate per-marker thresholds (detection thresholds and analytical thresholds) for filtering will typically require a non-trivial amount of testing with the laboratory's NGS sequencing instrument(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this mock example is helpful in building intuition about haplotype calling, manual visual examination is not feasible for performing this task on dozens of markers and (potentially) millions of NGS reads.\n",
