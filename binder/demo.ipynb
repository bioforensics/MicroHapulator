    "**MicroHapulator** is an application for empirical haplotype calling, analysis, and basic forensic interpretation of microhaplotypes with NGS data.\n",
    "This notebook is designed to introduce MicroHapulator to new users and demonstrate its features.\n",
    "The software is normally run by entering commands in a UNIX shell terminal window (available on Linux, MacOS, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux).\n",
    "\n",

    "For convenience, however, this notebook provides an interactive environment that interleaves narrative text, shell commands that the reader can execute and re-execute, the output of those commands, and additional explanatory commentary.\n",
    "To execute a block of code in the notebook, select the corresponding notebook cell and then click the `[> Run]` button at the top of the page (or as a keyboard shortcut, simultaneously press `[shift]` and `[enter]`).\n",

    "This demo assumes the reader is familiar with basic terminology and concepts related to biology, genomes, and NGS sequencing.\n",
    "A [primer on forensic DNA typing](https://microhapulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/primer.html) is available for any reader unfamiliar with the topic.\n",
    "A brief description of MicroHapulator's [core haplotype calling procedure](https://microhapulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/typing.html) is also provided.\n",
    "These readings are recommended before beginning this demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, before we dive in, we need to define a function we'll use to display images in this interactive notebook (adapted from [this blog post](https://datascienceworkshops.com/blog/ibash-notebook/)).\n",
