# MicroHapulator

**MicroHapulator** is software for empirical haplotype calling, analysis, and basic forensic interpretation of microhaplotypes from Illumina sequence data.
Also included are tools for constructing mock genotypes and simulating Illumina sequencing of single- and multiple-contributor samples for testing and development purposes.
MicroHapulator can be configured for use with any published or custom panel.
[MicroHapDB](https://github.com/bioforensics/microhapdb) can be used to prepare marker definitions, population frequencies, and reference sequencesâ€”see [the configuration documentation](config.md) for more details.

If you're new to forensic DNA analysis, [this primer](primer.md) is the recommended entry point for the documentation.
